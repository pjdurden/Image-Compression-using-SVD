# Image-Compression-using-SVD
## Agenda
1. To study and understand Image Compression  and its applications.
2. We will discuss various aspects and steps involved in SVD and its utilization in image compression.
3. We will attempt to understand how the concept of SVD in image compression is implemented and how to maintain balance between compression and image quality.

This project is based on analysis of the level of quality and image size constructed by image compression using Singular Value Decomposition.
